# Alex_CG2111A_S2G2

In the Alex Challenge, we built a robot named Alex that can be controlled via the Internet. Equipped with various units, Alex maps the surrounding area and avoids collisions with walls and other objects. Our mission is to remotely explore and map a room using Alex, while also scanning for specific target objects.

This is the source code for CG2111A Alex project.
